    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Include as detailed description as possible and preferably also literature/background if needed. If you want static images or animated videos.
      Example details: 2D/3D, style, colorblind friendly, subject area e.g. "biophysics", topic "dynamic movement of RNA", methods "NMR-spectroscopy".
    <p>
    <h2>Design Programs/Tools</h2>
    <p>
    I combine a variety of tools for graphical design and animations. Mostly Biorender, InDesign, manim (animations), pycharm/python, AI generations, blender, photoshop and others.
    I use both "presets" and/or self-designed images/objects. Come at me purists!
    <p>
      <h2>Websites</h2>
    <p>
     I can also make websites, but I'm rather new to this, so approach at your own risk!
    <p>
      <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>
     As I'm currently building up a portfolio I'm free of charge around the board!
